This is an in progress native Android frontend for the Lute-v3 Server https://github.com/LuteOrg/lute-v3

The theming of this app was created while using the Dusk.css theme. I highly recommend adding this theme to your Lute Servers Theme folder and then activating it from settings. 


Created in Zed using Qwen Code and OpenCode and is almost entirely written by an LLM
